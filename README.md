# Welcome to kickstarter!

Hi! I'm Navish. I have created this because if you start any application with express, you just download/clone it then folder structure and authentication module will be ready.


## Folder structure

## Setup

 1. Download the folder from https://github.com/smartnav/kickstarter-node-express.git
 2. cd kickstarter-node-express (Into the directory)
 3. npm i (Install npm moudles)
 4. npm start

Open the browser with http://localhost:4000

Enjoy!!
